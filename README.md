# godot_spongePlatformer

This repo contains the files for a game I'm making in Godot. I'm uploading them here to get some feedback from the wonderful people over on r/godot before I continue development. To view the project in the Godot editor, download the zipped file and extract the contents. I would upload each folder seperately, but I thought that a ZIP file would be easier.

If you have any problems with opening or viewing the files, please let me know.
